## init post

I have finally taken the next step to create this website as a way to showcase things I have learnt or projects I am working on.

Currently, I'm planning to post about three areas:
> Establishing a team and creating operational excellence
> Side hustle projects
> The blockchain and my personal views on developing a blockchain ecosystem

To create this blog in the first place required quite a number of basic steps.

I followed these core principles
1. Do everything as cheaply as possible
2. Try to do as much as seems practical to get exposure to a wide range of technical concepts about how things actually work
3. Keep things bite sized (I don't have huge amounts of time to sit and go deep on anything)

These are my goals for this blog
1. Don't let great get in the way of good - I plan to try and publish a post a week
2. Speak from experience - I will try to stick to things I have done and share my personal experiences
3. Make my mum proud - Write in a way that my parents can understand and follow

I'll need to come back to this initial post and see how closely I've managed to follow my principles and goals.

For those wanting to repeat the website portion of what I've done, I'm using Github pages. This will mean my Github (https://github.com/samctan/samctan.github.io) will become a handy reference for all the updates I've made to the blog.

The hard things done right are the right things.
