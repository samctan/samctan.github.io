# init post

I have finally taken the next step to create this website as a way to showcase things I have learnt or projects I am working on.

### What this blog will cover
Currently, I'm planning to post about three areas:
- Establishing a team and creating operational excellence
- Side hustle projects
- The blockchain and my personal views on developing a blockchain ecosystem

To create this blog in the first place required quite a number of basic steps.

### Blog core principles
I followed these core principles
- Do everything as cheaply as possible
- Try to do as much as seems practical to get exposure to a wide range of technical concepts about how things actually work
- Keep things bite sized (I don't have huge amounts of time to sit and go deep on anything)

### Blog goals
These are my goals for this blog
- Don't let great get in the way of good - I plan to try and publish a post a week
- Speak from experience - I will try to stick to things I have done and share my personal experiences
- Make my mum proud - Write in a way that my parents can understand and follow

I'll need to come back to this initial post and see how closely I've managed to follow my principles and goals.

### Close
For those wanting to repeat the website portion of what I've done, I'm using Github pages. This will mean [my Github repo](https://github.com/samctan/samctan.github.io) will become a handy reference for all the updates I've made to the blog.
