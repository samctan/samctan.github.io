# Starting a blog

In this post, I hope to capture the steps I when creating and publishing this blog.

## Context

> Why do we need another blog?

For the last few years I've wrestled with this question. This question is similar to why take another photo of a popular natural site (i.e. mountain or waterfall) or another photo of your family at the Taronga zoo view of the Sydney city.

I think the arguments can be laid out with the following:

| For | Against |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Provide a publicly accessible reference point for digital work products | Waste of time i.e. do something that no one cares about or sees |
| Learn something new | Do something that no one cares about or sees |
||Do something that has already been done a million times|


## Process

| # | Step | Description|
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |----------------------- |
|1.|Identify what's involved| Figure out the various things involved in setting up a blog|
|2. |Make some decisions|+ Choose how and where you want the website hosted + Decide on what you plan to write about|
|3. |Publish something| + Get started blogging. This seems like the easiest part but was actually much harder for me then doing everything else.|

## Detailed breakdown

### Choose an implementation option
You can choose to implement your blog in a variety of ways. The major categories I identified are:

| Option | Pros | Cons |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Host it on Github Pages | <ul><li>Free </li><li>Lots of documentation and help online </li></ul>|<ul><li>Limited to what Github Pages support </li><li>Test editing done in a developer environment i.e. text based</li></ul>|
| Choose a turn key SaaS vendor | <ul><li>wysiwyg user interface </li><li>lots of templates to choose from </li><li>Very fast</li></ul>| <ul><li>Highest cost</li></ul>|
| Host on a cloud provider |<ul><li>Max learning</li><li>Max configurability</li></ul> | <ul><li>Medium cost </li><li>Still requires significant technical learning to coordinate between cloud provider, setup environment for webpage etc</li></ul>|
| Host on your own server |<ul><li> Max learning</li></ul> |<ul><li> Lowest cost without giving up flexibility of setup</li><li>Need your server to be running 24/7</li><li>Fixed IP costs</li></ul>|

### Choose a template

### (Optional) Choose how you want to setup a custom domain

## Other considerations

### Setting up a custom domain name on Github Pages

Setting up a custom domain makes everything just look slick.

There are alot more things to setup if you do this. I only learnt what was required for Github Pages setup as that is what I did

#### Step 1. Setup DNS records on your domain service

##### Side note re: redirects

You don't need them at all for Github Pages custom domain name setup but these confused me alot

+ 301
+ 302
+ Forwarding with masking

### https? To be secure or not to be secure
