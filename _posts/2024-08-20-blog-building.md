# Starting a blog

In this post, I hope to capture the steps I when creating and publishing this blog.

## Context

> Why do we need another blog?

For the last few years I've wrestled with this question. This question is similar to why take another photo of a popular natural site (i.e. mountain or waterfall) or another photo of your family at the Taronga zoo view of the Sydney city.

I think the arguments can be laid out with the following:

| For | Against |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Provide a publicly accessible reference point for digital work products | Waste of time i.e. do something that no one cares about or sees |
| Learn something new | Do something that no one cares about or sees |
||Do something that has already been done a million times|


## Process

| # | Step | Description|
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |----------------------- |
|1.|Identify what's involved| Figure out the various things involved in setting up a blog
|2. |Make some decisions|+ Choose how and where you want the website hosted + Decide on what you plan to write about|
|3. |Publish something| + Get started blogging. This seems like the easiest part but was actually much harder for me then doing everything else.|

## Detailed breakdown

### Choose an implementation option
You can choose to implement your blog in a variety of ways. The major categories I identified are:

| Option | Pros | Cons |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Host it on Github Pages | 
+ Free 
+ Lots of documentation and help online | 
+ Limited to what Github Pages support 
+ Test editing done in a developer environment i.e. text based|
| Choose a turn key SaaS vendor | 
+ wysiwyg user interface 
+ lots of templates to choose from 
+ Very fast | 
+ Highest cost|
| Host on a cloud provider |
+ Max learning
+ Max configurability | 
+ Medium cost 
+ Still requires significant technical learning to coordinate between cloud provider, setup environment for webpage etc|
| Host on your own server |
+ Max learning
+ |
+ Lowest cost without giving up flexibility of setup
+ Need your server to be running 24/7
+ Fixed IP costs|

### Choose a template

### (Optional) Choose how you want to setup a custom domain

## Other considerations

### Setting up a custom domain name on Github Pages

Setting up a custom domain makes everything just look slick.

There are alot more things to setup if you do this. I only learnt what was required for Github Pages setup as that is what I did

#### Step 1. Setup DNS records on your domain service

##### Side note re: redirects

You don't need them at all for Github Pages custom domain name setup but these confused me alot

+ 301
+ 302
+ Forwarding with masking

### https? To be secure or not to be secure
